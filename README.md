# volume of simplex
This code base follows the implementation of volume of simplex (sections and slices) by Lasserre's work in closed form.

Everything is implemented using numpy (and python). The visualizations are in matplotlib.

The code is well documented and annotated to help understand what is happening in each and every stage.
